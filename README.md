Program has a text interface and it can be used to choose an animal and to make animal do some-thing. Text interface will tell user what animal does. Animals are divided to pets and wild animals and user has to choose between these two. After that he is presented with list of animals. At any time, when user has option to choose, user can choose option to go back to previous option or to exit program.  
  
Pets have following actions to be chosen: eat, talk to owner, make sound, come here and give name. Eat action gives text prompt that animal ate and gained 1 kg and how much it weighs now, weight would increase after each eat action. Talk to owner action would give a text prompt that animal talked to owner on its own way, for example, “Bird tweeted to owner”. Make sound action would result animal creating sound in some randomly chosen way like breaking a branch. Give name action would change how animal is addressed to name that user gives it.  
  
Wild animals have actions make sound and hunt. Make sound works same as with pets and hunt would let animal to find food with 60% chance. If it does find food user would get description of an-imal finding food and gaining random amount of mass and how much it weighs now.
